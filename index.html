     <p style="font-family:calc(); font-size:large;">Jimzo, meaning “clay art” (with jim meaning clay and zo meaning art), is one of Bhutan’s oldest and most sacred traditional crafts.
        Its origins trace back to the 7th century during the time of Tibetan King Songtsen Gampo, when pioneering temples such as Kichu Lhakhang and Jampa Lhakhang were built. Evidence of 
        early clay paintings from the time of Guru Rinpoche further shows that clay sculpting existed in Bhutan long before it was officially recorded. The art became more widespread during
        the time of Terton Pema Lingpa in the 15th century, and later, in the 17th century, it was formally codified as one of the Zorig Chusum—the thirteen traditional arts and crafts of 
        Bhutan—by the Fourth Druk Desi, Gyalse Tenzin Rabgye.
        During the 17th century, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal invited the great sculptor Trulku Dzing to Bhutan, who created remarkable clay figures in Punakha and Wangduephodrang Dzongs. Since 
        then, the techniques of jimzo have been passed down from master sculptors (Jimzo Lopoen) to students for generations. Bhutanese sculptors are well-known for their delicate craftsmanship, 
        strict precision, and deep devotion, as religious clay sculptures must follow exact iconographic measurements for the body, limbs, facial features, ornaments, and attire. Creating these 
        statues is considered a highly spiritual act, believed to bring merit and blessings.
        Clay art in Bhutan includes a wide range of objects such as religious statues of Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, deities, saints, gods, and goddesses, as well as ritual objects, clay masks worn during festivals, 
        and tsha-tsha (miniature clay stupas). These sculptures can be as small as a few centimeters or as large as over twenty feet, and they are found in almost every temple, monastery, dzong, and even in Bhutanese homes.
        Jimzo uses three main types of clay—tsa-dam, kong-dam, and jim-dam. These are made using naturally found clay often mixed with desho, the traditional paper made from the bark of the Daphne plant, 
        to make the material stronger and long-lasting. Sculptors also add precious substances such as gold, silver, pearl, turquoise, and coral to enhance the spiritual value of the statues. The sculpting
        process begins by measuring the exact size needed, then building a frame using copper, iron, or even gold and silver wires. Layers of clay are carefully added, shaped, and carved, and the statue is 
        left to dry naturally. Once dried, a zung—a sacred core containing mantras and relics—is inserted by a monk before the final painting and the rabney (consecration ceremony) are completed.
        Jimzo holds great social, cultural, and spiritual importance in Bhutan. Sculpting is regarded as an act of devotion, and the creations serve as objects of worship, faith, and reverence for Buddhists.
        Because clay figures are found everywhere and are always in demand, it is also a valuable source of income for sculptors. To preserve and promote this ancient craft, the Royal Government of Bhutan 
        established institutions such as the National Institute for Zorig Chusum (1971) and the Trashiyangtse Institute for Zorig Chusum (1967). These institutions train young Bhutanese in traditional arts like painting,
        woodcarving, metal casting, weaving, and especially jimzo, keeping Bhutan’s artistic heritage alive for future generations. </main>

             <img src="img.webp" width="800" height="300" alt="The 2025 Learning Framework" >
      </div>
     <p> The Learning Framework serves as the foundational structure that shapes all activities and educational processes at The Royal Academy, part of the Druk Gyalpo’s Institute. 
         This framework works in harmony with the Bhutan Baccalaureate Learning Process, creating a dynamic and reciprocal relationship where each influences the other. The Learning 
         Framework is implemented through the Learning Process, while insights gained from the Learning Process inform the design and refinement of the Learning Framework for subsequent years.
         Central to the Learning Framework is its balanced emphasis on the Five Areas of Development, ensuring that each area receives equal attention. The Learning Process is dedicated to the
         continuous enhancement of students’ Skills, Processes, and Watermark—elements that are vital for holistic growth. This framework is not static; it evolves in response to the needs of individuals, 
         the school, and the broader community. The Five Areas of Development, along with the Skills, Processes, and Watermark, serve as essential pillars that support and guide the Learning Framework, 
         ensuring it remains relevant and effective in fostering student development. In essence, the Learning Framework is designed to be adaptable and responsive, ensuring that it meets the diverse needs 
         of learners while promoting their comprehensive growth. This synergy between the Learning Framework and the Learning Process fosters an enriching educational environment that prepares students to 
         thrive both academically and personally.

   <section>
     <h2>About My Project</h2>
     <div>
      <p>
        At our school, education goes beyond textbooks and exams. We focus on the overall growth of every learner through five key areas of development — Cerebral, Emotional, Physical, Social, and Spiritual.
        These five areas work together to help students think critically, stay healthy, build strong relationships, manage emotions, and live mindfully. The goal is to nurture well-rounded individuals who
         are curious, compassionate, responsible, and confident, ready to contribute positively to their communities and the world.
      </p>
      <h2>Holistic Development</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Cerebral Area Of Development</b> <br>
        Cerebral development focuses on learning and thinking skills. It strengthens abilities in English, Dzongkha, and Mathematics, while connecting lessons to Science, Sports, Arts, and ICT. Students 
        learn how to think, analyze, and apply knowledge creatively rather than just memorize facts.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Emotional Area Of Development</b> <br>
        Emotional development helps students understand and manage their feelings in a positive way. It encourages a safe and caring environment where everyone can express themselves and build confidence and self-awareness.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Physical Area Of Development</b> <br>
        Physical development promotes health, hygiene, and fitness through sports and physical activities. Students learn teamwork, leadership, and communication while staying active and healthy.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Social Area Of Development</b> <br>
        Social development focuses on building positive relationships with friends, teachers, and the community. It encourages students to be honest, open-minded, and responsible members of society 
        who contribute to a just and harmonious world.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Spiritual Area Of Development</b> <br>
        Spiritual development centers on mindfulness, compassion, and empathy. It inspires students to find joy, peace, and purpose in everything they do, guided by Buddhist values and a sense of 
        interconnectedness with others and the environment.
