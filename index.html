        <p style="flex:1; font-size: large; margin-top: 20px;"> I'm Tshering Namgyel Dorji, a proud student at The Royal Academy. When I'm not in class, you can usually find me outdoors, where I feel most alive when I'm playing football with full energy. These activities sharpen my focus, build my discipline, and teach me the importance of balance and perseverance, lessons that I carry into everything I do.
            Beyond my love for the outdoors, I have a deep passion for traditional Bhutanese arts and history. I find myself drawn to the stories, symbols, and cultural roots that shape who we are as Bhutanese. At the same time, I’m equally curious about the narratives of the wider world, always wanting to understand how different cultures, histories, and ideas connect. This curiosity inspires me to keep exploring, learning, and creating through art, research, or hands on projects.
            As a student, I strive to combine my love for physical activity with my interest in creativity and knowledge. I believe that learning doesn't just happen in the classroom; it happens through experiences, challenges, and the passions that push us forward. My goal is to continue growing in all these areas while staying true to the values I’ve learned both at school and through Bhutan’s rich heritage.

    <p style="flex:1; font-size: large; margin-top: 20px;">My featured work here is a personal Jimzo sculpture. Even though the model looks simple at first, it carries deep meaning for me as a student and as someone who is genuinely curious about Bhutanese art. Working on it allowed me to connect my creativity with my learning in a way that felt both personal and meaningful. Every step from shaping the clay to thinking about the symbolism reminded me that art is not just made with the hands, but also with intention, patience, and understanding.
       My inspiration comes directly from the context of The Royal Academy of Mindfulness. This framework guides my education by helping me balance the Five Areas of Development while continuously improving my Skills, Processes, and Watermark. I realized that mindfulness is not only something practiced during meditation but also during the careful, focused work required to create a sculpture. The project became a way for me to apply what I learn every day at school: being present, thoughtful, and aware of my actions.
       Creating this Jimzo piece also made me see how traditional crafts are connected to modern learning. The discipline, focus, and steady progress needed to sculpt clay reflect the same structure and dedication needed to succeed in academics, projects, and personal growth today. Jimzo requires patience and attention to detail, just like developing strong thinking skills or building character. Through this project, I understood that ancient arts and modern education are not separate but they support and strengthen one another.
       By sharing this blend of art, academics, and personal interests, I hope you gain a richer understanding of what motivates me as a learner. This sculpture is more than just a piece of work; it represents my curiosity, my effort, and the values I practice at The Royal Academy. It is a small example of how I try to connect who I am with what I learn, and how both continue to shape the person I am becoming.

        Jimzo, meaning “clay art” (with jim meaning clay and zo meaning art), is one of Bhutan’s oldest and most sacred traditional crafts.
        Its origins trace back to the 7th century during the time of Tibetan King Songtsen Gampo, when pioneering temples such as Kichu Lhakhang and Jampa Lhakhang were built. Evidence of 
        early clay paintings from the time of Guru Rinpoche further shows that clay sculpting existed in Bhutan long before it was officially recorded. The art became more widespread during 
        the time of Terton Pema Lingpa in the 15th century, and later, in the 17th century, it was formally codified as one of the Zorig Chusum the thirteen traditional arts and crafts of 
        Bhutan by the Fourth Druk Desi, Gyalse Tenzin Rabgye.

    <p style="font-size: large; margin-top: 15px;">
      <br>During the 17th century, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal invited the great sculptor Trulku Dzing to Bhutan, who created remarkable clay figures in Punakha and Wangduephodrang Dzongs. Since 
      then, the techniques of jimzo have been passed down from master sculptors (Jimzo Lopoen) to students for generations. Bhutanese sculptors are well-known for their delicate craftsmanship, 
      strict precision, and deep devotion, as religious clay sculptures must follow exact iconographic measurements for the body, limbs, facial features, ornaments, and attire. Creating these 
      statues is considered a highly spiritual act, believed to bring merit and blessings.

    </div>
    <p style="flex:1; font-size: large; margin-top: 20px;">When I look at my model, I see more than just a sculpture; I see a visual journey that brings together everything I learned about meditation.
        At first, it may appear to be a simple meditating figure, but for me, every part of it carries meaning. The calm posture of the figure shows the inner stillness and clarity that I came to understand 
        through this project, while the Dharma Wheel beneath it immediately connects the model to the deeper teachings of Buddhism. Together, these elements create a full picture of what meditation represents.
        I also see the model as a blend of the old and the new. The figure is shaped in a modern style, representing someone like me or anyone living today who is trying to find balance in a busy world. In contrast,
        the Dharma Wheel symbolizes ancient wisdom that has guided people for generations. By combining the two, my model shows how meditation still remains meaningful and relevant, no matter how much time has passed.
        To me, the sculpture is a reminder that meditation is not just about sitting quietly. It is supported by many aspects of mindfulness, ethics, discipline, and understanding just like the Dharma Wheel supports 
        the figure. When I look at it this way, I see meditation as something much bigger: not just a practice, but a way of living with awareness, kindness, and purpose.
        Overall, I see my model as a symbol of harmony. It brings together focus and openness, modern life and tradition, and personal well-being with the values of my community. Creating it helped me understand meditation on
        a deeper level, and now the finished model continues to represent that learning every time I see it.

       </div>
    <p style="flex:1; font-size: large; margin-top: 20px;"> The meditating figure at the center of the model represents the core idea of meditation. Its calm and balanced posture expresses inner peace, mental clarity, and 
        emotional stability. The way the figure sits reflects both major forms of meditation: Focused Attention is shown through the slightly directed posture that suggests 
        concentration on a single point, while the relaxed and open positioning of the body represents Open Monitoring, where one simply observes thoughts without judgment. 
        Together, the figure shows that meditation is a blend of focus and openness, discipline and gentleness.
       <div class="ialign">
         <img src="khorlo.jpg" 
         alt="My Sculpting Project" 
         class="sculpt-img"
         style="width: 500px; height: auto;">
       </div>
    </p>
    <p style="flex:1; font-size: large; margin-top: 20px;">
        The model is built on a Dharma Wheel, which adds deeper meaning to the entire structure. The wheel carries the symbolism of the Noble Eightfold Path through its eight spokes, 
        reminding us that meditation is part of a larger path of wisdom and understanding. At the center of the wheel, the hub represents moral discipline. This is the foundation that 
        keeps the whole path steady, showing that ethical behavior and compassion support a strong meditative practice. Surrounding the spokes is the rim, which stands for mindful concentration. 
        Just as the rim holds the wheel together, mindfulness helps maintain balance and clarity in daily life.
        Placing a modern figure on top of this ancient Buddhist symbol shows the connection between traditional teachings and present-day well-being. It reflects how meditation continues to remain 
        relevant, helping individuals build inner peace while also promoting harmony in the community. The design brings together the past and the present, suggesting that these teachings still guide people today.
        Overall, the structure of the sculpture shows meditation as a complete experience that includes focus, peace, ethics, and mindfulness. The combination of the calm figure and the symbolic wheel expresses how 
        creating the model was not just an artistic task but an experience that deepened understanding. The model captures the idea that meditation is not only studied but also lived, practiced, and felt.
