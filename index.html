     <p style="font-family:calc(); font-size:large;">Sculpting, or jimzo, is one of Bhutan’s oldest and most respected traditional crafts. Its origins can be traced back to at least the 7th century, 
        during the construction of ancient temples like Jampa Lhakhang and Kichu Lhakhang. Later, in the 17th century, jimzo was officially recognized as one of the Zorig Chusum, the thirteen traditional 
        arts and crafts of Bhutan, during the time of Gyalse Tenzin Rabgye. Sculpting in Bhutan began with clay long before metals like bronze were used, and clay sculptures are still admired for their beauty, 
        delicacy, and spiritual meaning. Although they are hollow on the inside, they represent powerful religious figures, stories, and landscapes, making them an important part of Bhutanese culture.
        Traditionally, clay sculpting has been practiced mainly by men, while pottery has been the responsibility of women. Both crafts are valued for their usefulness and cultural significance. Pottery, 
        which follows ancient methods of shaping and baking clay, is still used in everyday life, especially in regions such as Gangzur in Lhuentse and parts of eastern Bhutan. Bhutanese clay sculptures are 
        considered among the finest in the Himalayan region, and many skilled Bhutanese sculptors were even invited to create statues in Tibetan monasteries.
        Another important part of jimzo is the making of tsatsas—small sacred objects molded from clay. Sometimes, the ashes of deceased family members are mixed with the clay to create tsatsas as a way to 
        honor their memory. These objects are often placed in caves, under rocks, inside stupas, or in sheltered places along the road. They are usually painted white, red, or gold, and they hold deep religious and 
        emotional meaning for Bhutanese families.Overall, jimzo continues to play a vital role in preserving Bhutan’s heritage, showing the skill, devotion, and creativity of Bhutanese artisans throughout history.   </section>

     <div class="ialign">
             <img src="img.webp" width="800" height="300" alt="The 2025 Learning Framework" >
      </div>
     <p> The Learning Framework serves as the foundational structure that shapes all activities and educational processes at The Royal Academy, part of the Druk Gyalpo’s Institute. 
         This framework works in harmony with the Bhutan Baccalaureate Learning Process, creating a dynamic and reciprocal relationship where each influences the other. The Learning 
         Framework is implemented through the Learning Process, while insights gained from the Learning Process inform the design and refinement of the Learning Framework for subsequent years.
         Central to the Learning Framework is its balanced emphasis on the Five Areas of Development, ensuring that each area receives equal attention. The Learning Process is dedicated to the
         continuous enhancement of students’ Skills, Processes, and Watermark—elements that are vital for holistic growth. This framework is not static; it evolves in response to the needs of individuals, 
         the school, and the broader community. The Five Areas of Development, along with the Skills, Processes, and Watermark, serve as essential pillars that support and guide the Learning Framework, 
         ensuring it remains relevant and effective in fostering student development. In essence, the Learning Framework is designed to be adaptable and responsive, ensuring that it meets the diverse needs 
         of learners while promoting their comprehensive growth. This synergy between the Learning Framework and the Learning Process fosters an enriching educational environment that prepares students to 
         thrive both academically and personally.

     <h2>About My Project</h2>
     <div>
      <p>
        At our school, education goes beyond textbooks and exams. We focus on the overall growth of every learner through five key areas of development — Cerebral, Emotional, Physical, Social, and Spiritual.
        These five areas work together to help students think critically, stay healthy, build strong relationships, manage emotions, and live mindfully. The goal is to nurture well-rounded individuals who
         are curious, compassionate, responsible, and confident, ready to contribute positively to their communities and the world.
      </p>
      <h2>Holistic Development</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Cerebral Area Of Development</b> <br>
        Cerebral development focuses on learning and thinking skills. It strengthens abilities in English, Dzongkha, and Mathematics, while connecting lessons to Science, Sports, Arts, and ICT. Students 
        learn how to think, analyze, and apply knowledge creatively rather than just memorize facts.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Emotional Area Of Development</b> <br>
        Emotional development helps students understand and manage their feelings in a positive way. It encourages a safe and caring environment where everyone can express themselves and build confidence and self-awareness.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Physical Area Of Development</b> <br>
        Physical development promotes health, hygiene, and fitness through sports and physical activities. Students learn teamwork, leadership, and communication while staying active and healthy.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Social Area Of Development</b> <br>
        Social development focuses on building positive relationships with friends, teachers, and the community. It encourages students to be honest, open-minded, and responsible members of society 
        who contribute to a just and harmonious world.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Spiritual Area Of Development</b> <br>
        Spiritual development centers on mindfulness, compassion, and empathy. It inspires students to find joy, peace, and purpose in everything they do, guided by Buddhist values and a sense of 
        interconnectedness with others and the environment.
