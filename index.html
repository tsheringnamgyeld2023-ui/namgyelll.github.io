     <p style="font-family:calc(); font-size:large;">The Royal Academy is a co-educational, residential institution under the Druk Gyalpo’s Institute, serving students from Grades VII to XII.
        Its mission is to foster a diverse and balanced student community that reflects the national character and cultural experiences of Bhutan. 
        The selection process at The Royal Academy is continually evolving, with diversity and equity at its core, ensuring representation from all 20 Dzongkhags.
        The Academy aims to equip students with the skills and qualities necessary for realizing their full potential. Self actualization is viewed not as a 
        final destination but as a state where individuals can act with wisdom and responsibility. Regardless of whether students pursue artistic, technical, physical,
        or academic paths, upon graduation, they should possess the resilience and determination to navigate their learning journeys and find their own way forward.
        Additionally, students should cultivate a sense of purpose that informs their decisions and actions. They are encouraged to be aware of and responsive to the 
        needs of their communities both human and environmental and to apply their skills and knowledge thoughtfully, becoming valuable contributors to society.

      </div>
     <p> The Learning Framework serves as the foundational structure that shapes all activities and educational processes at The Royal Academy, part of the Druk Gyalpo’s Institute. 
         This framework works in harmony with the Bhutan Baccalaureate Learning Process, creating a dynamic and reciprocal relationship where each influences the other. The Learning 
         Framework is implemented through the Learning Process, while insights gained from the Learning Process inform the design and refinement of the Learning Framework for subsequent years.
         Central to the Learning Framework is its balanced emphasis on the Five Areas of Development, ensuring that each area receives equal attention. The Learning Process is dedicated to the
         continuous enhancement of students’ Skills, Processes, and Watermark—elements that are vital for holistic growth. This framework is not static; it evolves in response to the needs of individuals, 
         the school, and the broader community. The Five Areas of Development, along with the Skills, Processes, and Watermark, serve as essential pillars that support and guide the Learning Framework, 
         ensuring it remains relevant and effective in fostering student development. In essence, the Learning Framework is designed to be adaptable and responsive, ensuring that it meets the diverse needs 
         of learners while promoting their comprehensive growth. This synergy between the Learning Framework and the Learning Process fosters an enriching educational environment that prepares students to 
         thrive both academically and personally.

     <h2>Five Areas of Development</h2>
     <div>
      <p>
        At our school, education goes beyond textbooks and exams. We focus on the overall growth of every learner through five key areas of development — Cerebral, Emotional, Physical, Social, and Spiritual.
        These five areas work together to help students think critically, stay healthy, build strong relationships, manage emotions, and live mindfully. The goal is to nurture well-rounded individuals who
         are curious, compassionate, responsible, and confident, ready to contribute positively to their communities and the world.
      </p>
      <h2>Holistic Development</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Cerebral Area Of Development</b> <br>
        Cerebral development focuses on learning and thinking skills. It strengthens abilities in English, Dzongkha, and Mathematics, while connecting lessons to Science, Sports, Arts, and ICT. Students 
        learn how to think, analyze, and apply knowledge creatively rather than just memorize facts.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Emotional Area Of Development</b> <br>
        Emotional development helps students understand and manage their feelings in a positive way. It encourages a safe and caring environment where everyone can express themselves and build confidence and self-awareness.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Physical Area Of Development</b> <br>
        Physical development promotes health, hygiene, and fitness through sports and physical activities. Students learn teamwork, leadership, and communication while staying active and healthy.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Social Area Of Development</b> <br>
        Social development focuses on building positive relationships with friends, teachers, and the community. It encourages students to be honest, open-minded, and responsible members of society 
        who contribute to a just and harmonious world.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Spiritual Area Of Development</b> <br>
        Spiritual development centers on mindfulness, compassion, and empathy. It inspires students to find joy, peace, and purpose in everything they do, guided by Buddhist values and a sense of 
        interconnectedness with others and the environment.
